# 👋 Hi, I’m Luis Ca  
**ML Engineer | Forecasting · MLOps**

From **engineering the subsurface** (tunnels, foundations, energy systems) ⛰️
to **engineering AI/ML systems in the cloud** ☁️

---

## 🌎 About Me
I began my career as a **civil & geotechnical engineer**, analyzing rock and soil to design safe tunnels, slopes, and deep foundations.  
Later, as a **consultant**, I advised companies on excavation and foundation projects, analyzing site conditions, optimizing construction processes, and leading client training and reporting.  
During my MSc in  **Applied Earth Sciences (Geo-Energy, TU Delft)**, I explored the energy transition — geothermal, hydrogen, CO₂ storage, and petroleum systems — learning to manage uncertainty in complex subsurface environments. This was also the stage where I connected my background in engineering with **data science and machine learning**, putting these skills into practice on real-world subsurface and energy problems.

That journey trained me to **analyze complex systems under uncertainty** — skills I now apply to **AI/ML**, where I design:
- 📈 **Forecasting & Predictive Modeling** — Construction, Energy, Pharma, Retail, Finance  
- ⚙️ **MLOps** — Databricks workflows, MLflow tracking & registry, CI/CD, deployment, monitoring  

✨ My goal: **Build robust, production-ready AI/ML systems — from raw data to monitored deployment.**
