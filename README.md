# 👋 Hi, I'm Luis Ca

**ML Engineer | Applied AI & MLOps**

From **engineering the subsurface** (tunnels, foundations, energy systems) ⛰️ to **architecting tailored AI/ML solutions** ⚙️ for complex industrial systems.

## 🌎 About Me

I began my career as a **civil & geotechnical engineer**, analyzing rock and soil to design safe tunnels, slopes, and deep foundations. Later, as a **consultant**, I advised companies on excavation and foundation projects, evaluating site conditions, optimizing construction processes, and leading client training and reporting.

During my MSc in  **Applied Earth Sciences (Geo-Energy, TU Delft)**, I worked on energy-transition topics - geothermal, hydrogen, CO₂ storage, and petroleum systems — and learned to navigate uncertainty in complex subsurface environments. This was also where I connected my engineering background with **data science and machine learning**, putting these skills into practice on real-world subsurface and energy problems.

That journey trained me to **analyze complex systems under uncertainty** — a skillset I now apply to **AI/ML**. Today, I bring an **Engineering First** mindset to:
- 🏗️ **Building Tailored ML Solutions:** building systems that respect domain constraints, not just generic models.
- ⚙️ **MLOps & Productionalization:** turning models into robust, reproducible, and monitored systems.
- 📈 **Forecasting & Predictive Modeling:** Pharma, Energy, Geoscience.

> 🎯 **My goal:** Build robust, production-ready AI/ML systems — from raw data to monitored deployment.
